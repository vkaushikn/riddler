    "# Riddle\n",
    "You and your friend are playing a game of [“Acchi, Muite, Hoi”][1] (or what some on Twitter have been calling the [“lookaway challenge”][2]). In the first round, you point in one of four directions: up, down, left or right. At the exact same time, your friend also looks in one of those four directions. If your friend looks in the same direction you’re pointing, you win! Otherwise, you switch roles as the game continues to the next round — now your friend points in a direction and you try to look away. As long as no one wins, you keep switching off who points and who looks.\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems like your chances of winning should be 50 percent, since there are exactly two players. But surely it’s not that simple. If both you and your friend choose your directions randomly in each round, what are your chances of winning?\n",
